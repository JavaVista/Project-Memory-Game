# Project: Memory Game

## Overview

Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree project.

### Task

Built my own version of the classic memory game "Concentration", using JavaScript, DOM selectors, and Event listeners.

## Game Instructions

The board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down.

* Flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!
* You can reset the game at any time by pressing the reset icon or by pressing the "R" key.
* Once you have found all of the matching cards, the winning screen appears with a summary of your game (moves, stars, time) and you can play again by pressing the button.

**On each turn**:

* The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
